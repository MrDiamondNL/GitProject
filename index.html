                <h3 id="git-add">Git add</h3>
                <p id="git-add">Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3 id="git-branch">Git Branch</h3>
                    <p id="git-branch">This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.</p>                
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3 id="git-commit">Git Commit</h3>
                <p id="git-commit">Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3 id="git-fetch">Git Fetch</h3>
                <p id="git-fetch">Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you a chance to inspect changes before merging them with your project.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3 id="git-init">Git Init</h3>
                <p id="git-init">
                    Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3 id="git-log">Git Log</h3>
                <p id="git-log">Lets you explore the previous revisions of a project. It provides several formatting options for displaying committed snapshots.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3 id="git-merge">Git Merge</h3>
                <p id="git-merge">A powerful way to integrate changes from divergent branches. After forking the project history with git branch, git merge lets you put it back together again.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3 id="git-pull">Git Pull</h3>
                <p id="git-pull">Pulling is the automated version of git fetch. It downloads a branch from a remote repository, then immediately merges it into the current branch. This is the Git equivalent of svn update.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3 id="git-push">Git Push</h3>
                <p id="git-push">Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions. This is like svn commit, but it sends a series of commits instead of a single changeset.</p>
